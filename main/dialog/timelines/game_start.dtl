A vast, gray, desolation stretches in all directions. Dead trees grow haphazardly around you, as if repulsed.
You are cold to the point of desparation. You can feel your bones freezing in the gelatin of your blood.
You are hungry more than anything. A small animal, to you, would be nothing more than sustenance.
And you are alone. Utterly, utterly alone.
At least until the darkness clears.
