Oh, yeah. I know a little about time. I can give you the current time at almost any given moment, though never the previous or following moment or moments. It's not easy, telling time. Not when it's so spread out, you see. All over the place.
Though, in my old age, I can't tell the current time from any other time I've ever told. All the different times are just floating around in my head. You're free to dig around in there, just go in through my ear. Either one.
